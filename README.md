# _C++_ to _Rust_ converter
## A simple C++ to *Rust* translator written in Rust.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++ is a system programming language widely used in development of operating system,  firmwares, device drivers and in some application development. Major drawback with C++ or any other system programming language is memory safety, null pointers and dangling pointers, which are very dangerous if not handled properly by the programmer.  
The new programming language *Rust* is system programming language provides the safe and secure programming with highly enforced compiler restrictions with zero cost abstraction.
------------------------------------------------------------------------  
This tool is intended to translate existing C++ code base into Rust with less effort.
May require manual lookup or minute edit to the translated code.
